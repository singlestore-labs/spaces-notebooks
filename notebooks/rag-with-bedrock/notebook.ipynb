        "\n",
        "When trying to solve a Question Answering task over a larger document corpus with the help of LLMs we need to master the following challenges (amongst others):\n",
        "- How to manage large document(s) that exceed the token limit\n",
        "- How to find the document(s) relevant to the question being asked\n",
        "\n",
        "### Infusing knowledge into LLM-powered systems\n",
        "\n",
        "We have two primary types of knowledge for LLMs:\n",
        "- **Parametric knowledge**: refers to everything the LLM learned during training and acts as a frozen snapshot of the world for the LLM.\n",
        "- **Source knowledge**: covers any information fed into the LLM via the input prompt.\n",
        "\n",
        "When trying to infuse knowledge into a generative AI - powered application we need to choose which of these types to target. Fine-tuning, explored in other workshops, deals with elevating the parametric knowledge through fine-tuning. Since fine-tuning is a resouce intensive operation, this option is well suited for infusing static domain-specific information like domain-specific langauage/writing styles (medical domain, science domain, ...) or optimizing performance towards a very specific task (classification, sentiment analysis, RLHF, instruction-finetuning, ...).\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast to that, targeting the source knowledge for domain-specific performance uplift is very well suited for all kinds of dynamic information, from knowledge bases in structured and unstructured form up to integration of information from live systems. This Lab is about retrieval-augmented generation, a common design pattern for ingesting domain-specific information through the source knowledge. It is particularily well suited for ingestion of information in form of unstructured text with semi-frequent update cycles.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook we explain how to utilize the RAG (retrieval-agumented generation) pattern originating from [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11401.pdf) paper published by Lewis et al in 2021. It is particularily useful for Question Answering by finding and leveraging the most useful excerpts of documents out of a larger document corpus providing answers to the user questions.\n",

Also, if you want to control how many relevant documents should be retrieved then change the `k` parameter in the cell below to see different outputs. In many scenarios you might want to know which were the source documents that the LLM used to generate the answer, you can get those documents in the output using `return_source_documents` which returns the documents that are added to the context of the LLM prompt. `RetrievalQA` also allows you to provide a custom [prompt template](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/prompts/prompt_templates/getting_started.html) which can be specific to the model.\n",
