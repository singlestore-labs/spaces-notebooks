      Query to track amount of repartitioning and broadcasting operations caused
      by queries
    </p>

    <div class="container my-5">
      <h4 class="title is-4" style="color: #9900ff">Background</h4>
      <div id="querycontext" class="block has-text-dark my-3 px-2">
        <p>
          <strong>Repartitioning</strong> happens during a distributed join when
          the shard key that matches the join condition is stored on different
          partitions. In such cases, the query optimizer creates an internal,
          temporary results table in memory with a shard key that matches the
          join condition, allowing the join to be performed across the different
          partitions
        </p>

        <p>The downsides of repartitioning include</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            increased network traffic as data is shuffled across nodes, which
            can lead to higher latency and potential performance bottlenecks
            during query execution.
          </li>
          <li>
            Additionally, it requires more connections and threads, which can
            strain system resources if not managed properly by workload
            management tools1.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          To avoid repartitioning, you can choose a shard key for your table
          based on columns that you frequently join or filter on, ensuring that
          the join operations can be executed locally within the partitions.
          This minimizes network traffic during query execution and avoids the
          need for creating temporary results tables in memory for
          repartitioning
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Broadcasting</strong> happens during a distributed join when
          one of the joining tables is small. This allows for the small table to
          be sent to every node where it is joined with the larger table stored
          on those nodes
        </p>
        <p>Downsides of broadcasting include</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Increased network traffic as the small table is sent to every node.
          </li>
          <li>
            Potential memory pressure on nodes if the small table is larger than
            initially anticipated.
          </li>
          <li>
            Overhead associated with distributing the table to all nodes, which
            may not be efficient for slightly larger tables.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>To avoid broadcasting, you can</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Design your schema to ensure that tables you join on share matching
            shard keys, thus enabling local joins instead of distributed joins.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use reference tables for small, infrequently changing tables that
            need to be present on every node in the cluster to guarantee local
            joins.
          </li>
          <li>
            Optimize your queries and schema to minimize the need for
            broadcasting by considering the shard key selection and whether
            certain tables should be joined in the first place.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          To identify if repartitioning and broadcasting are the most expensive
          operations using a query plan profile, you can follow these steps
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Run the problematic query in the SQL Editor and click the Visual
            Explain icon to display the query plan in a graphical interface 1.
          </li>
          <li>
            Choose the PROFILE option to display further details for each query
            operation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Look for the presence of Repartitioning in the query plan, as it is
            a common indicator of reshuffling or repartitioning a lot of data.
            Also, check for large SELECT costs combined with a Project operator
            2.
          </li>
          <li>
            Examine the query plan for the Broadcast operation, which occurs
            when a small table is sent to every node for a join operation 3.
          </li>
          <li>
            By inspecting these elements within the PROFILE, you can determine
            if repartitioning or broadcasting is contributing significantly to
            the overall cost of the query.
