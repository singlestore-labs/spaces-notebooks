        "### Context\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook will help you with four core key principles for getting performance out of SingleStoreDB using TPCH Benchmark. SingleStoreDB is a distributed database, so you should think of using shard keys, database partitions, primary keys and indexes for getting the best performance out of it.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### About database partitions\n",
        "The generalized recommendation for most clusters is to have 4 CPU cores per database partition on each leaf. This means if you had a cluster with 16 cores on each of 4 leaves (64 CPU cores total across all leaf hosts), you would want to have 4 partitions on each leaf (16 partitions throughout the cluster). If you are using a S00 workspace, you will have 2 partitions per database. ***Note*** *that increasing partitions will have additional memory and caching overheads, which can be expensive if you have thousands of tables*\n",
        "\n",
        "##### About shard keys\n",
        "Data is distributed across the SingleStoreDB Cloud workspace into a number of partitions on the leaf nodes. The shard key is a collection of the columns in a table that are used to control how the rows of that table are distributed. To determine the partition responsible for a given row, SingleStoreDB Cloud computes a hash from all the columns in the shard key to the partition ID. Therefore, rows with the same shard key will reside on the same partition.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### About hash indexes\n",
        "They are highly efficient for exact-match lookups (point-reads). Because hash indexes store rows in a sparse array of buckets indexed through a hash function on the relevant columns, queries can quickly retrieve data by examining only the corresponding bucket rather than searching the entire dataset. This enables significant reduction in lookup time and hence, increased performance for specific query types.\n",
        "\n",
        "**For that tutorial, we recommend using a workspace of size S4 to ingest data faster and also see the difference and gain you can get from a distributed architecture.**"
